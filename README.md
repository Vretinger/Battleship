# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship Game! This project is a python terminal-based implementation of the classic Battleship game where you can play against the computer. The game runs in the Code institute mock terminal on Heroku. 

The game involves strategic placement and guessing of ship locations to sink your opponent's fleet before they sink yours.
